## A Stevens AIRS Fellowship Project

Created by [Jolene Ciccarone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jolene-ciccarone-357b681b5/) and [Jared Donnelly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredonnelly/) under the guidance of their mentor [Dr. Samantha Kleinberg](http://www.skleinberg.org/) and [Dr. Jason Corso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-corso-95b66a24/). 

Below we cover a proof of concept for a predictive model to estimate the size of homeless populations using publicly available data for NYC.

### Model Performance

The current version of our model uses 4 factors: Max Temperature, Precipitation, Unemployment Rate, and Number of Public High School Graduates. We use these factors to estimate characteristics from the public New York Daily Public Shelter Data such as Number of Families in Shelter. Please check our 'Data Sources' section for more information on where our data came from. 

Here is an example of a set of estimations from our test data compared to the actual values.

Overall our factors can explain 58% of the varriation within our data according to the coeffiecent of determination (r-squared). We still believe the model is usefully because it 

### Code Break Down 

We should insert snipbits of our code and process here, discussing pieces and parts that we developed and learned. It is good to remember that the code is already publicly available

### Reccomendations for Future Research

In the future we would like to see similar projects expanded to other cities and communities. Furthermore, work can be done specifically for improving the effectiveness of programs such as the work done by Dr. Eric Rice when designing a new method for selecting peer leaders.
