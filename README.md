## A Stevens AIRS Fellowship Project

Created by [Jolene Ciccarone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jolene-ciccarone-357b681b5/) and [Jared Donnelly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredonnelly/) under the guidance of their mentor [Dr. Samantha Kleinberg](http://www.skleinberg.org/). 

Below we cover a proof of concept for a predictive model to estimate the size of homeless populations using publicly available data for NYC.

### Model Performance

Our model works, and we should add visualizations here, it would also be good to include metrics and some analysis of its performance.

### Code Break Down 

We should insert snipbits of our code and process here, discussing pieces and parts that we developed and learned. It is good to remember that the code is already publicly available

```markdown
Code would go here
```

Analysis would go here

### Reccomendations for Future Research

We should include a breif paragraph about the future work that could be done and perhaps highlight other work being done with homelessness data to help the community such as the papers we read by Eric Rice.

### Data Sources

Include links to our data.

### Additional Resources

Include links to any other sources
